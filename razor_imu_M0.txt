1.  Ref http://wiki.ros.org/razor_imu_9dof
2.  Using imu board 14001 https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14001
3.  Download ROS, Arduino IDE and Download dependencies from board manager to 
4.  Link the board to the Linux Computer port /dev/ttyACM0
5.  Open the Seriel Monitor in Arduino IDE. 
6.  Type #oc in the Seriel Monitor Command Line to enter the accelerometer calibration mode. 
7.  Take the board and point straight down with x, y, z axes and do the same thing in oppisite side to get the MAX and min calibration value and write it down. 
8.  Type #on in the Seriel Monitor Command Line to enter the magnitude calibration mode and do the same thing as 7.
9.  Type #on again to get into Gyro calibraion mode, and do the same thing as 7. 
10. Download Processing IDE and its EJML library. 
11. Download razor_imu_9dof to the catkin_ws/src directory.
12. Open the Magnetometer Calibration file in catkin_ws/src/razor_imu_9dof/magnetometer_calibration/Processing directory.
13. Run the code. It will pop-up a new window with a surphace. If not, then press r to restart. 
14. Move the razor imu to make the dots cover the surphace in the pop-up window. Press Space to show the calibration value.
15. Write the calibration value into my_razor.yaml in the /catkin_ws/src/razor_imu_9dof/config directory.
16. Download convert_to_rpy.py from https://github.com/tychien/mitseagrantauv 
17.$ Roslaunch razor_imu_9dof razor-pub.launch 
18. In another new terminal, $ python2 convert_to_rpy.py 
19. $rostopic echo /heading     to show the heading.


I've tried to do all these work including calibration and measuring on the metal desk, 
so it still drifting after calibration. 
Then I moved the razor imu to the wood desk and do the works again, 
the drifting problem has been improved. 
Try to avoid the magnetic field distortion by removing the electornic devices 
and keep the imu away from metal objects would make the drifting problem better.
